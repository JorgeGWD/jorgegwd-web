                        <p>I have had to develop some projects from scratch and others already started, as well as redesign some already finished, always looking to <span>implement new tools and technologies</span> that allow me to obtain <span>the best result</span>.</p>
                        <p>To make this possible, I also dedicate myself to researching and learning about everything related to <span>new web development technologies</span>. This learning process has been part of my life for quite some time now and I hope it will be for much more.</p>
